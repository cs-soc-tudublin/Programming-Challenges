 *	Write a parser which takes a given set of instructions and prints an output based on said instructions.
 *
 *	parser begins with a value at zero
 *	'i' = increments the value
 *	'd' = decrements the value
 *	's' = squares the value
 *	'o' = outputs the value and resets it to zero
 *	
 *	Instructions are stored as strings and passed into the parser
